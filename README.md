# Mean-variance-analysis
Mean-Variance Analysis is a fundamental concept in modern portfolio theory that helps investors balance risk and return. It evaluates investment options by comparing their expected returns (mean) against the variability of those returns (variance). The goal is to construct a portfolio that maximizes return for a given level of risk.
